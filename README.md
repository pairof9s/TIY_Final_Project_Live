## D9 Final Project


My Final Project is the development of Pool Party, a do-it-yourself car pool signup application. Designed for parents of school students in the area, it allows you to have an online location to create or join groups of other parents who have kids that are friends and/or in the same school as your children, and wish to participate in a car pool together.

The application will allow you to sign up, then sign in to initially create your group. This group provides the name of students, their parents, and their address so you can decide whose convenient to your location, for example. Then your login page will be a central spot for seeing the members of your group with their contact information, as well as an area showing the weekly driving schedule. There's also a convenient comment area to discuss with other parents topics like switching days or weeks, or perhaps whose child is sick and should not be picked up.

The Pool Party app is developed in React with various components that include a sign up form, login authentication and logout, student list selection for creating a group, and the displaying of group information of individual records ("student members"). The app is responsive and can be further modified to accurately display as a mobile app later.

Future development will include the online modifying of the schedule, the editing of Groups (to remove members no longer wishing to be in it), the automation of email confirmation to activate the Group and notify its members, and eventually in the mobile version, the ability to GPS track pick up & drop off routes for parents as well as automated text messages when your child has arrived at school.

## Steps:
1. At Welcome page, click on "Click here" link in either intro copy or under login form for new signups.
2. At Sign Up page, fill out form completely (2nd parent is optionanl) and submit.
3. Upon return to Welcome page, insert your Username and Password on the login form. (FYI, parse server is slow and sometimes takes time to register new user...give it 5 minutes to be sure.)
4. Initial login will take you to Group setup page. Select names of 4 students you'd like to be in your group and hit Create Group.
5. Upon creating group, you'll be directed to Schedules page which lists your group and its members, shows weekly schedule, and has discussion area to post comments.
